If you need more time, you are able to submit a new request once your account is cleared of overdue interlibrary loan titles. This lets us get a copy from a different system, and honor the agreements we made with the libraries that share their collections with us. It also helps to avoid any non-refundable processing fees or replacement costs.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions. And if you have returned this book since the date above? Please accept our sincerest thanks!`,navigator.clipboard.writeText(letterContent);}();
